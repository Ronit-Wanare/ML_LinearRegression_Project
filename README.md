## ML_LinearRegression_Project
-->This project is on linear regression model based real life application using Sk learn as a primary tool for regression, and used the following(.csv file) data to predict price of a vehicle on the basis of  various parameters provided.
--
-->The data is splited into parts i.e train and test data to overcome overfitting , regression is performed on train data and test data is used for making predictions
--
-->Also dealed with outliers by removing the top 1%data ,also dealed with dependent variables with the help of OLS assumption
--
-->The Following are the Assumptions made before performing the regression the sorted data.
--
# 1. No Endogenity Assumption
# 2. No auto correlation
# 3. Normality and Homoscedasticity(due to log transformation)

--> Steps that can be taken to improve the following model.
--
# 1.Use different set of variables
# 2.Remove a bigger part of outliers
# 3.Use different kind of transformation
